# Google Hashcode 2021- Java Solution

Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. My team, Astryn, competed for the the 
Online Qualifications, and turned out quite well for a first-time competor.

This repository is the sample solution we built during the four hours, and also hold quite alot of memories.

Although maybe not accurate, this program is able to route from point A to B successsfully and produce expected results with-in seconds. Some input files provided during 
the competition are still attached. Feel free to clone and test the code out.
